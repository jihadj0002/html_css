Bootstrap has a wide range of responsive margin and padding utility classes. They work for all breakpoints:

xs (<576px), sm (>=576px), md (>=768px), lg (>=992px) or xl (>=1200px))

The classes are used in the format:

{property}{sides}-{size} for xs & {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size} for sm, md, lg, and xl.

Where property is one of:

m - for classes that set margin
p - for classes that set padding
Where sides is one of:

t - for classes that set margin-top or padding-top
b - for classes that set margin-bottom or padding-bottom
l - for classes that set margin-left or padding-left
r - for classes that set margin-right or padding-right
x - for classes that set both *-left and *-right
y - for classes that set both *-top and *-bottom
blank - for classes that set a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element
Where size is one of:

0 - for classes that eliminate the margin or padding by setting it to 0
1 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .25
2 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .5
3 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer
4 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 1.5
5 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 3
